# OncoReconcile AI

## Human-Governed Oncology Reconciliation Workbench

OncoReconcile AI transforms messy oncology entities into trusted canonical oncology concepts with evidence, explainability, confidence scoring, and human review recommendations.

This project is being developed for the DFWIT AI & Startup Competition by Team Variant Vanguard.

## One-Sentence MVP

OncoReconcile AI is a human-governed oncology reconciliation workbench that transforms messy cancer types, genes, and variants into trusted canonical oncology concepts with evidence, explainability, confidence scoring, and review recommendations.

---

## Problem

Real-world oncology data often uses inconsistent names for the same concept.

Examples:

| Messy Input | Canonical Concept |
|---|---|
| NSCLC | Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer |
| LUAD | Lung Adenocarcinoma |
| HER2 / HER-2 | ERBB2 |
| p53 | TP53 |
| EGFR Ex19del | EGFR Exon 19 Deletion |
| HER2 Amplification | ERBB2 Amplification |

These inconsistencies make it difficult to support:

- Data harmonization
- Cohort creation
- Evidence aggregation
- Multi-vendor data integration
- Population analytics
- AI-ready oncology datasets

## MVP Scope

### In Scope

- CSV upload
- Manual JSON/API input
- Cancer type reconciliation
- Gene reconciliation
- Variant reconciliation
- Evidence context
- AI-generated explanation
- Confidence scoring
- Review recommendation
- Result table
- CSV/JSON output

### Out of Scope for MVP

- PDF extraction
- OCR
- Therapy recommendation
- Clinical decision support
- Clinical interpretation
- Drug recommendation
- Trial matching
- GraphRAG
- Production-grade knowledge graph

## Output Status Categories

Every input record should end in one of three states:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| AUTO_RECONCILE | High-confidence match |
| REVIEW_REQUIRED | Ambiguous or medium-confidence match |
| CANNOT_RECONCILE | No reliable match found |

## Quick Start: Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Test:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/reconcile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cancer_type":"NSCLC","gene":"HER2","variant":"Amplification"}'
```

---

## Quick Start: Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Team Working Rule

AI can generate code, but humans own:

- API contracts
- MVP scope
- integration
- review logic
- demo quality

Before coding, read:

1. `docs/mvp.md`
2. `contracts/api_contract.md`
3. `docs/weekly_plan.md`
4. `docs/onboarding.md`

---

## This Week's Goal

Build one working vertical slice:

```text
CSV/manual input
↓
Backend reconciliation
↓
Result table
```

One working record is better than five disconnected components.
