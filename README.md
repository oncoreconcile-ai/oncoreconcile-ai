# OncoReconcile AI

A trustworthy, explainable, and human-governed MVP for oncology gene and variant reconciliation.

## MVP Scope & Principles

- **Trustworthy AI**: All outputs are traceable, auditable, and explainable.
- **Explainability**: Every normalization includes a human-readable explanation and confidence score.
- **Provenance & Auditability**: All evidence sources and decision steps are recorded for each result.
- **Human Governance**: Ambiguous or unresolvable cases are flagged for human review.
- **Deterministic First**: Deterministic normalization is always attempted before AI reasoning.
- **Evidence, Not Recommendations**: External sources (ClinVar, CIViC, OncoKB, COSMIC) are cited as evidence, not as clinical recommendations.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Extraction (OCR, parsing) is separate from semantic interpretation.

## MVP Focus

- Only SNVs/simple HGVS/common oncology aliases in initial scope.
- Small, highly explainable, and auditable codebase.
- Ready for rapid iteration and demo in a 7–8 week competition.

See `src/reconciliation_schema.py` and `data/examples/canonical_schema/` for canonical schema and output examples.

## Data Governance Guidance

To ensure transparency, reproducibility, and ethical use of data in this project, all contributors and future data updates must follow these principles:

1. **Provenance and Documentation:**
        - Clearly document the source, method of acquisition, and any synthesis or curation steps for all new data files.
        - Maintain or update the provenance and reproducibility documentation (see `oncoreconcile_starter/PROVENANCE_AND_REPRODUCIBILITY.md`).

2. **Synthetic and Real Data:**
        - Clearly distinguish between synthetic (AI- or human-generated) and real-world data.
        - Do not include any real patient data or protected health information (PHI) unless explicit approval and compliance steps are followed.

3. **Public Data Use:**
        - Only use public, redistributable data sources or those with appropriate licenses for open-source projects.
        - Attribute all external data sources in documentation and code as appropriate.

4. **Reproducibility:**
        - When possible, provide scripts or detailed steps for how new data was generated or processed.
        - Ensure that others can reproduce or extend the dataset using the provided documentation.

5. **Ethics and Compliance:**
        - Follow all applicable data use agreements, licenses, and ethical guidelines.
        - If in doubt, consult with project leads before adding new data.

For more details and examples, see `oncoreconcile_starter/PROVENANCE_AND_REPRODUCIBILITY.md`.

**AI-assisted oncology gene and variant reconciliation platform**

OncoReconcile AI is a DFWIT AI Competition project focused on turning messy oncology gene and variant strings into traceable, reviewable canonical knowledge objects. The project is intentionally human-governed: AI and deterministic logic help reconcile data, but ambiguous or low-confidence mappings must preserve uncertainty and flow into review instead of being forced into a false answer.

## Disclaimer

This is a research and educational prototype. It is not clinical software, does not make clinical claims, does not diagnose disease, and does not recommend treatment.

## Project Goal

Precision oncology data often arrives from different labs, reports, databases, and bioinformatics pipelines with inconsistent names for the same biological concept. Examples include `HER1`, `ERBB1`, and `EGFR`, or `EGFR Ex19del`, `E746_A750del`, and `p.E746_A750del`.

The goal of this repo is to build a small, credible MVP that demonstrates:

- Gene alias reconciliation against curated HGNC-style reference data.
- Variant representation reconciliation for common oncology examples.
- Confidence-aware status assignment: `reconciled`, `needs_review`, and `cannot_reconcile`.
- Human review and audit trail concepts.
- Traceable outputs that preserve original evidence, canonical mappings, confidence, provenance, and review status.

The first demo scope is intentionally narrow: lung adenocarcinoma-oriented examples with genes such as EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, TP53, MET, ALK, and ERBB2/HER2; SNVs and small indels; and curated demo data rather than large raw genomics downloads.

## Current MVP Status

As of May 2026, the repo contains:

- A FastAPI backend scaffold with reconciliation and review endpoints.
- A deterministic CSV-backed gene reconciliation endpoint at `POST /reconcile/gene`.
- A variant reconciliation workflow with extraction, normalization, retrieval, reasoning, confidence scoring, and review queue modules.
- Curated reference data under `data/reference/v0.1/`.
- Starter NSCLC demo data under `oncoreconcile_starter/`.
- A Streamlit demo UI under `frontend/`.
- Architecture, proposal, weekly execution plan, meeting agenda, and GitHub issue planning docs.
- Passing pytest coverage for the current starter workflow.

Some planned production-grade pieces are still placeholders, including semantic embedding retrieval, LLM reasoning integration, persistent database storage, and full frontend/backend review actions.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Tests

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

### Run Backend

```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Run Streamlit Demo

If the backend is running locally:


```bash
export API_URL=http://localhost:8000
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
```

*This ensures the frontend connects to your local backend. If you see 'Cannot connect to API', check this step.*

If running through Docker Compose, the frontend defaults to the Docker service URL `http://api:8000`.

### Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## API Examples

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Gene Reconciliation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/reconcile/gene \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"gene_name": "HER1", "source": "demo"}'
```

Expected result: `HER1` maps to canonical gene `EGFR` with deterministic alias provenance from `data/reference/v0.1/gene_aliases.csv`.

### Variant Reconciliation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/reconcile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "raw_variant": "EGFR Ex19del",
    "source": "local_lab",
    "tissue": "lung_nsclc"
  }'
```

### Review Queue

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/review-queue
```

Google Docs copies have also been created for the proposal, weekly plan, and architecture/task map so the team can review and comment outside GitHub.

## Team Workflow

The initial backlog is tracked as GitHub issues #1 through #12 in `michaeliuedu/oncoreconcile-ai`.

Recommended contributor flow:

1. Pick an issue based on interest and dependency readiness.
2. Create a focused branch, for example `issue-3-batch-csv-reconcile`.
3. Keep changes small and tied to the issue.
4. Run `python -m pytest -q` before pushing.
5. Open a pull request and link the issue.

The issue creation helper is intentionally safe by default:

```bash
sh scripts/create_github_issues.sh
```

This lists the planned issues and does not create duplicates. Creation modes require explicit confirmation.

## MVP Priorities

P0 work:

- Canonical reconciliation output schema.
- Curated demo CSV dataset.
- Batch CSV reconciliation endpoint.
- Explicit reconciliation status logic.
- Cannot-reconcile and ambiguity handling.

P1 work:

- Review decisions wired to an audit log.
- Upload and results UI.
- Review queue UI.
- API documentation and local runbook.
- Demo case design document.
- Pitch deck outline.
- Demo smoke test checklist.

## Technical Stack
