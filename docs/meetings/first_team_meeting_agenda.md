## Troubleshooting: Kill and Restart Backend/Frontend

If you need to restart both the backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Streamlit), use these commands:

**Kill all running processes:**
```bash
pkill -f streamlit && pkill -f uvicorn
```

**Restart backend:**
```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

**Restart frontend (with correct API_URL):**
```bash
export API_URL=http://localhost:8000
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
```

*If you see 'Cannot connect to API', always check that both backend and frontend are running and that API_URL is set correctly.*

## Proactive Work on Blocked Issues & Backlog

Team members are encouraged to proceed proactively:

- **Blocked issues** can be started as soon as their dependencies are completed—even within the same sprint. If you finish your assigned task early, check if any blocked issue is now unblocked and begin work immediately.
- If a blocked issue is not yet ready, you can:
	- Help review or test ongoing work.
	- Prepare scaffolding, documentation, or test cases for the next blocked issue.
	- Pick up or propose “nice-to-have” (P2) or technical debt issues (e.g., refactoring, improving test coverage, enhancing documentation).
	- Draft user stories, UI mockups, or additional demo scenarios.

### Blocked Issues: When Can They Start?

| Issue | Can Start When... | Early Prep/Backlog Ideas |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| #3    | #1 & #2 done      | API/test scaffolding    |
| #5    | #4 done           | Uncertainty test cases  |
| #6    | #1 & #4 done      | Audit log design/tests  |
| #7    | #3 done           | UI wireframes           |
| #8    | #4 & #6 done      | UI/UX planning          |
| #10   | #2 done           | Outline/case notes      |
| #12   | #3 & #7 done      | Checklist template      |

As soon as a dependency is finished, the blocked issue can be started—no need to wait for the next sprint. Team members can also work on backlog or support tasks while waiting. This keeps everyone productive and the project moving forward.

## Hands-On Activities for the Meeting

Make your meeting more efficient and engaging by including these hands-on activities:

1. **Live Repo Clone & Setup**
	- Everyone clones the repo and checks out the correct branch.
	- Command: `git clone https://github.com/michaeliuedu/oncoreconcile-ai.git`
	- Command: `git checkout gene-reconciliation`
	- Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Run the Test Suite**
	- Everyone runs `pytest -q` and confirms all tests pass (current: 18 passed).

3. **Start the Backend and Frontend**
	- One person shares their screen to run `uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload` and `streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py`.
	- Others follow along on their own machines.

4. **Try a Demo Input**
	- Use the Streamlit UI to submit a sample variant and walk through the workflow.
	- Show the API docs at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

5. **Assign Issues Live**
	- Use the GitHub Issues page to let each member claim a task.
	- Fill out the task claim template together.

6. **Quick Code/Docs Edit**
	- Make a small change (e.g., update a README or add a comment), commit, and push as a group to demonstrate the workflow.

7. **Q&A and Troubleshooting**
	- Allow time for anyone stuck on setup to get help immediately (screen sharing encouraged).

**Tip:**
- Encourage everyone to try these steps on their own machines after the meeting.

## Agenda

### 1. Welcome and Meeting Goal: 5 minutes

Purpose:

- Welcome team members.
- Explain that this is a competition MVP project.
- Set the tone: practical, demo-focused, human-governed AI.

Opening message:

> OncoReconcile AI is a trustworthy, human-governed AI workflow for reconciling messy oncology gene and variant names into traceable canonical outputs. We are not building clinical decision software. We are building an interoperability and governance demo that preserves uncertainty, provenance, and auditability.

### 2. Problem and Vision: 10 minutes

Use:

- [Competition Proposal Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18LXDOTTN-USMY87vyVr84RbKx4wY-iaYbksnUknI1Ck)

Cover:

- Why precision oncology data is messy.
- Gene examples: `HER1 -> EGFR`, `p53 -> TP53`.
- Variant examples: `EGFR Ex19del -> EGFR exon 19 deletion`.
- Why uncertainty matters: `EGF-RX -> cannot_reconcile`.
- Human-governed AI is the differentiator.


### 3. Current Repository Walkthrough & Demo Checklist: 10 minutes

Use:

- [Repository](https://github.com/michaeliuedu/oncoreconcile-ai)

## Sprint 1: Week 1–2 Task Assignments and Dependencies

This section summarizes the actionable work for the first two weeks, based on current features, issues, and dependencies.

### What Can Be Started (Week 1–2)

Assign 1 developer per unblocked P0/P1 issue:

1. **Canonical Output Schema (#1)**
	- Backend/data modeling
	- Unblocks batch endpoint, audit log, and UI

2. **Demo CSV Dataset (#2)**
	- Data curation
	- Unblocks batch endpoint tests, demo doc

3. **Status Logic (#4)**
	- Backend/AI
	- Unblocks review queue, audit, frontend badges

4. **API Docs/Runbook (#9)**
	- Docs/backend
	- Can be started and updated as endpoints are built

5. **Pitch Deck Outline (#11) or Demo Case Doc (#10)**
	- Docs/business/demo
	- #11 can start now; #10 can start as soon as #2 is underway

#### Example Week 1–2 Assignments Table

| Member | Primary Task                | Support/Review         | Docs/Demo/Testing      |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1      | #1 Canonical output schema  | #3 Batch endpoint      | #9 API docs/runbook    |
| 2      | #2 Demo CSV dataset         | #1 Schema              | #10 Demo case doc      |
| 3      | #4 Status logic             | #5 Cannot-reconcile    | #11 Pitch deck outline |
| 4      | #9 API docs/runbook         | #4 Status logic        | #12 Smoke test (draft) |
| 5      | #11 Pitch deck outline      | #2 Demo CSV            | #8 Review queue UI (plan)|

**If someone finishes early:**
- Help with #1, #2, or #4, or start on #3 (batch endpoint) as soon as #1 and #2 are done.

### Dependencies Recap

- Start with unblocked issues: #1, #2, #4, #9, #11.
- As soon as #1 and #2 are done, #3 (batch endpoint) can begin.
- As soon as #4 is done, #5 (cannot-reconcile) and #6 (audit log) can begin.
- Docs and pitch can be updated continuously.

This plan ensures all team members have actionable work and that dependencies are cleared for the next sprint.

> Our north star is a narrow, polished demo: upload messy oncology mutation examples, reconcile gene and variant names, show confidence and status, route uncertain cases to review, and preserve an audit trail. If we can do that clearly, we will have a strong competition project.


## Best Practices for Collaboration & Repo Stability

**Branching Strategy:**
- Each feature, bugfix, or task should have its own branch (e.g., `feature/xyz`, `bugfix/abc`).
- Work independently on branches; keep `master`/`main` stable.

**Frequent Commits & Pull Requests:**
- Make small, frequent commits with clear messages.
- Open pull requests (PRs) for review before merging to the main branch.

**Code Review:**
- Review each other’s PRs for code quality, logic, and style.
- Check for potential bugs, test coverage, and documentation.

**Automated Testing:**
- Run tests automatically (CI/CD) on every PR to catch issues early.
- Only merge PRs that pass all tests.

**Continuous Integration:**
- Use CI tools (e.g., GitHub Actions) to build, lint, and test the codebase on every push/PR.
- Ensure the main branch is always deployable.

**Documentation & Communication:**
- Update documentation as features are added or changed.
- Use issues, project boards, and regular meetings to coordinate work and track progress.

**Regular Syncs:**
- Rebase or merge the latest master into feature branches frequently to avoid conflicts.
- Hold short standups or async check-ins to keep everyone aligned.

**Additional Tips for Starting Collaboration:**
- Agree on coding style and formatting (consider using linters/formatters).
- Set up local environments and run all tests before starting work.
- Communicate blockers or questions early—don’t get stuck alone.
- Respect scope: avoid adding features or making large changes without team discussion.
- Celebrate small wins and help each other learn!
