## Parallel Development for Blocked Issues

To maximize team productivity, blocked issues can be developed in parallel using the following approach:

- **Create a feature branch** for each blocked issue.
- **Use mocks, stubs, or placeholder data** for any dependencies that are not yet implemented (e.g., API endpoints, schemas, or data files).
- **Coordinate interface contracts** (API schemas, function signatures, expected outputs) with the owners of blocking issues to minimize merge conflicts.
- **Write tests and documentation** as you go, using the mocked/stubbed interfaces.
- **Communicate regularly** with the team about progress and any changes to interfaces.
- **As soon as blockers are resolved:**
    - Rebase your feature branch onto the latest main/development branch.
    - Replace mocks/stubs with real implementations.
    - Run integration tests and resolve any conflicts.
    - Open a PR for review and merge.

**Example:**

- For #3 (Batch endpoint): Scaffold the endpoint and write tests using dummy data. After #1 and #2 are merged, update to use the real schema/data and integrate.
- For #7 (Upload/results UI): Build the UI with placeholder logic. After #3 is merged, connect to the real batch endpoint and test end-to-end.
- For #5, #6, #8, #10, #12: Follow the same pattern—develop logic, UI, or docs in isolation, then plug in and test as soon as dependencies are cleared.

This approach ensures all developers can contribute productively, and features can be integrated rapidly as soon as blockers are resolved.

## 1a. Issues That Can Be Started Without Blockers


The following issues can be started immediately (no dependencies):

- **#9: Add API documentation and local runbook**
- **#11: Prepare pitch deck outline**

**Note:**
- #1 (Canonical output schema), #2 (Demo CSV dataset), and #4 (Status logic) are now complete and open for team review. See the feature status table above.

Once #1, #2, and #4 were completed, #3 (batch endpoint) became unblocked. See the main meeting agenda for a full dependency table.

- **Green:** Complete or MVP-ready (current week)
- **Yellow:** Partial/in progress (needs work for full MVP)
- **Orange:** Next week
- **Red:** Future/blocked (post-MVP or dependent)

- **Green:** Complete or MVP-ready (current week)
- **Yellow:** In progress or next week
- **Red:** Future/blocked (post-MVP or dependent)
