## 1a. Issues That Can Be Started Without Blockers

The following issues can be started immediately (no dependencies):

- **#1: Define canonical reconciliation output schema**
- **#2: Create curated demo CSV dataset**
- **#4: Add explicit reconciliation status logic**
- **#9: Add API documentation and local runbook**
- **#11: Prepare pitch deck outline**

Once #1 and #2 are done, #3 (batch endpoint) can begin. See the main meeting agenda for a full dependency table.

- **Green:** Complete or MVP-ready (current week)
- **Yellow:** Partial/in progress (needs work for full MVP)
- **Orange:** Next week
- **Red:** Future/blocked (post-MVP or dependent)

- **Green:** Complete or MVP-ready (current week)
- **Yellow:** In progress or next week
- **Red:** Future/blocked (post-MVP or dependent)
